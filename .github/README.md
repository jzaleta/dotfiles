This configuration was made for my personal setup so some things might not work for you out-of-the-box. Feel free to go through the files in this repo and tweak everything to your liking! Just remember to create first a backup of your dotfiles (if any). 

## üîç Technical specifications

**I'm a self-taught software engineer and a medical student, which means my workflow is a bit unconventional.**

- I use both local tools on my computer for college and some projects and a virtual machine (Nix) that comes into play when dealing with specific development challenges.
- It's a pretty cool mix of practicality and adaptability.
- Definitely not something I could have tackled without overthinking and over-engineering).
