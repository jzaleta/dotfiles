My dotfiles include *zsh*, *brew*, *starship*, *vscode*, *nix*, *(n)vim* and *more* config files (stashed away in case of laptop armageddon).

This configuration was made for my personal setup so some things might not work for you out-of-the-box. Feel free to go through the files in this repo and tweak everything to your liking! Just remember to create first a backup of your dotfiles (if any). 

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Dotfiles are all the hidden settings and configuration files you have on your Unix system. You are expected to have a basic understanding of the unix system before starting.

**Install instructions:**

1. Clone my dotfiles repo with:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jzaleta/dotfiles
```

2. Run the [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) script inside your `$HOME` directory to install Oh-My-ZSH, Homebrew and apply my macOS settings!

3. Enjoy your new dotfiles!
